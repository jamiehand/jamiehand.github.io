# Hello!

![Welcome!](/img/photos/large/nbcu_newsgroup.jpg)

### I am Jamie Hand. I'm glad you're here -- enjoy, and have a great day!

I'm a rising super senior feb Computer Science major at
[Middlebury College](http://www.middlebury.edu).
What is a “super senior feb,” you ask? It's a Middlebury term for a student
who has one semester left. I will graduate in February (hence the “feb”)
of 2017.

This site is a work in progress, but please
look around and learn more about me, my interests,
and my work.

### I am a Computer Scientist.

In the summer of 2010, I first experienced the joy of teaching a computer to do
something in a robotics workshop at the Glenville State College NASA
Research Academy. We used sensors to direct the robot through an obstacle
course! Little did I know then, but that was the first of many computer
programs I would be designing.

Now, I am a software engineer, and
I am excited to be a Media Tech intern with NBCUniversal's News Group this
summer! I am currently developing a Slack bot in Node.js to help streamline
the code release process for NBCNews.com and Today.com. I am also collaborating
with fellow interns (remote and in Seattle) on an innovation project and will
be working on the NBCNew.com team later in the summer. The staff at NBCU's
Seattle office is wonderful, and I'm enjoying learning from them and
creating software that will improve their workflow. I'm looking forward to
what the rest of the summer holds!

### I am an explorer.

I took a year off after high school to live in Brazil as a Rotary Exchange
Student. I used my first two years of college as an experiment to see what I
wanted to major in — I considered Political Science, Economics, Biology, Math,
Japanese, Sociology, Religion, and Spanish, then — finally! — Computer Science.
In February 2015 I returned to school after a semester-long break (the reason I
am now a “feb”), which I spent exploring things like living life slowly, being
part of a band (I play violin and sing!), and learning how to cook!

### I am an activist.

Throughout the past few years, I have become increasingly aware of injustice
that occurs based on race, gender, sexual orientation,
self-expression, physical and mental ability, age, class, size,
geography, and other
factors. There are systems in the world that benefit some people to the
harm of others, and I am committed to working within myself and within the
communities I inhabit to give all people equal access to recognition and
resources.

So far my work in this has been mostly in encouraging diversity
in the field of technology. I have participated in several groups for women
in technology, including as a founding member of Middlebury College's
[Women in Computer Science ++](http://middleburywics.weebly.com/) and
participant with [Girl Develop It](http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-CentralVA/)
and [Charlottesville Women in Tech](http://www.charlottesvillewomenintech.com/).
I am also a Computer Science tutor at Middlebury, an informal mentor to
younger students, and involved in two mentorship groups.

I also recognize the importance of caring for the earth for the sake of
caring for people. I am not currently active in environmentally-focused groups,
but I support their efforts, and I personally work daily to reduce the
resources that I use and waste and negative impacts that I create. It's
a hard balance to find, but facing the challenge is important!

### I love to learn!

Everything intrigues me, and I want to understand it. I have recently worked
part-time submitting payment vouchers for a lawyer, washing dishes at a
restaurant, and setting up meals for conferences — and all of these have taught
me more about myself and about the world. I especially enjoy learning about
social justice, design, the technological systems that make our world work, and
new ways to approach problems. I also love to listen to people talk about
their interests -- to learn why their passions matter to them and
what I should know about those areas.
I look forward to what my future classes, work, and interactions will teach me!
