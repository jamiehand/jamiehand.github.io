title: Jamie Hand, Software Developer

## Hello!

### I am Jamie Hand. I'm glad you're here -- enjoy, and have a great day!

I'm a senior feb Computer Science major at
[Middlebury College](http://www.middlebury.edu).
What is a “senior feb,” you ask? Basically, it means I am half-junior,
half-senior. I will graduate in February (hence the “feb”) of 2017.


This site is also a work in progress, but please
look around and learn more about me, my interests,
and my work.

### I am a Computer Scientist.

In the summer of 2010, I first experienced the joy of teaching a computer to do
something. Here I am in a robotics workshop at the Glenville State College NASA
Research Academy. We used sensors to direct the robot through an obstacle
course! Little did I know then, but that was the first of many computer
programs I would be designing.

Now, I am a software engineer interested in learning all that
I can about software, computers, and the systems that make
our daily lives work. I recently interned with the [Center for Open
Science](http://centerforopenscience.org) doing software development,
working mostly with creating a Python client library
for interacting with the API for their main service,
the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io).
The client is still a work in progress (and that progress
passed into the hands of another developer at the end of
August 2015), but it can be found [here](https://github.com/jamiehand/osf_api_v2_client).

### I am an explorer.

I took a year off after high school to live in Brazil as a Rotary Exchange
Student. I used my first two years of college as an experiment to see what I
wanted to major in — I considered Political Science, Economics, Biology, Math,
Japanese, Sociology, Religion, and Spanish, then — finally! — Computer Science.
In February 2015 I returned to school after a semester-long break (the reason I
am now a “feb”), which I spent exploring things like living life slowly, being
part of a band (I play violin and sing!), and learning how to cook!

### I love to learn!

Everything intrigues me, and I want to understand it. I have recently worked
part-time submitting payment vouchers for a lawyer, washing dishes at a
restaurant, and setting up meals for conferences — and all of these have taught
me more about myself and about the world. I especially enjoy learning about software engineering (back end), information visualization/graphic design
(front end), and the technological systems that make our world what it is today.
I look forward to what my future classes and work will teach me!

### I will be in Seattle this summer!

I will be working on NBC Universal's media tech team as an intern in the summer
of 2016, and I am so excited! While there, I will continue to grow my skills
in web development (which I did a lot of in summer 2015 with the Center for
Open Science) and get my first taste of what it's like to work in media. Stay
tuned for updates on what I learn with NBCU!
