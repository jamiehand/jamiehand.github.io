# Hello!

![Welcome!](/img/photos/large/nbcu_newsgroup.jpg)

### I am Jamie Hand. I'm glad you're here -- enjoy, and have a great day!

I'm a super senior feb Computer Science major at
[Middlebury College](http://www.middlebury.edu).
(“Super senior feb” is a Middlebury term for a student
who has one semester left. I will graduate in February -- hence the “feb” -- of 2017.)

### I am a Computer Scientist.

In the summer of 2010, I first experienced the joy of teaching a computer to do
something in a robotics workshop at the Glenville State College NASA
Research Academy. We used sensors to direct the robot through an obstacle
course! Little did I know then, but that was the first of many computer
programs I would be designing.

Now, I am a software engineer, and
I am excited to have been a Media Tech intern with NBCUniversal's News Group this
past summer! In the internship, I developed a Slack bot in Node.js to help streamline
the code release process for [NBCNews.com](http://www.nbcnews.com/) and
[Today.com](http://www.today.com/). I also collaborated
with fellow interns (remote and in Seattle) on an innovation project and
presentation that won among several other intern groups.

I'm enjoying my last semester at Middlebury, and I'm excited to be looking for
full-time roles after graduation! My ideal position would involve both software
development and client interaction (e.g. in a consultant-like capacity,
designing solutions for clients' problems and working to implement those
solutions, including liaising between clients and developer teams implementing
solutions). My ideal location is Seattle because I have family there, but
I'm open to other locations!

### I am an explorer.

I took a year off after high school to live in Brazil as a Rotary Exchange
Student. I used my first two years of college as an experiment to see what I
wanted to major in -- I considered Political Science, Economics, Biology, Math,
Japanese, Sociology, Religion, and Spanish, then -- finally! -- Computer Science.
In February 2015 I returned to school after a semester-long break (the reason I
am now a “feb”), which I spent exploring things like living life slowly, being
part of a band (I play violin and sing!), and learning how to cook!

### I am an activist.

Throughout the past few years, I have become increasingly aware of injustice
that occurs based on race, gender, sexual orientation,
self-expression, physical and mental ability, age, class, size,
geography, and other
factors. There are systems in the world that benefit some people to the
harm of others, and I am committed to working within myself and within the
communities I inhabit to give all people equal access to the recognition and
resources that they need to thrive.

So far my work in this has been mostly in encouraging diversity
in the field of technology. I have participated in several groups for women
in technology, including as a founding member of Middlebury College's
[Women in Computer Science ++](http://middleburywics.weebly.com/) and
participant with [Girl Develop It](http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-CentralVA/)
and [Charlottesville Women in Tech](http://www.charlottesvillewomenintech.com/).
I am also a Computer Science tutor at Middlebury, an informal mentor to
younger students, and involved in two mentorship groups.

I also recognize the importance of caring for the earth for the sake of
caring for people. I am not currently active in environmentally-focused groups,
but I support their efforts, and I personally work daily to reduce the
resources that I use and negative impacts that I create. It's
a hard balance to find, but facing the challenge is important!

### I love to learn!

Everything intrigues me, and I want to understand it. I have volunteered
for audio/video at a conference, interned at a shelter for immigrants,
interviewed 24 students at an international graduate school, submitted
payment vouchers for a lawyer, washed dishes at a
restaurant, and helped set up meals for conferences.
I watch YouTube videos
on tech, problem solving, web design, personal branding, feminism,
social justice, world history, workouts, and whatever else catches my eye.
All of these teach
me more about myself and about the world. I especially enjoy learning about
social justice, design, the technological systems that make our world work, and
new ways to approach problems. I also love to listen to people talk about
their interests -- to learn why their passions matter to them and
what I should know about those areas.
I look forward to what my future classes, work, and interactions will teach me!
