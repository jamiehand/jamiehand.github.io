## Websites

* My first website was created with WordPress in January 2015. To create it, I
  purchased a web hosting package, registered and purchased a domain, and found a
  theme that I liked, even contacting the theme's makers when the theme
  was not behaving as expected. Designing that site was a lot of fun, and it was
  beautiful! But I wanted to go deeper into the code behind my website, which is
  why I decided to create...

* This website! The site you are looking at is hosted for free on GitHub.com
  (turns out every GitHub user gets a free personal website attached to their
  account)! I decided to make this my next website project because it meant
  I would learn several new technologies, including Markdown, Ruby, and Jekyll,
  and would get more experience with HTML and CSS. It has been an exciting journey
  so far, and there is still much more to learn!  

  This site currently looks much less fancy than the WordPress website I had (e.g.
  the WP site was fully responsive and had multiple columns that adjusted in size
  and location depending on the size of the viewing browser; it also had a lot
  more pictures!), but the GitHub site
  requires much more code work on my end and enables me to play with the code
  a lot more than WordPress did.  

  Another pro is that I'm not paying a yearly fee for web hosting, but I'm sure
  I will have future website projects for which I go back to using a paid service
  for hosting! This current site is just the next step in my journey as a
  web developer.
