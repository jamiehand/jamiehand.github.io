### Summer 2016

* ReleaseBot, a Slack bot to improve communication for the code
  release process for NBCUniversal News Group, built during a summer internship.
  I saw the bot from just an idea, to design, implementation, presentation to
  stakeholders, proof of concept, and into production. I also
  created thorough documentation for maintenance and further development of
  ReleaseBot and on-boarded another developer to maintain the bot after my
  internship ended. While designing the bot, I also worked closely with a
  coworker to define a concise Jira workflow that accurately reflected
  the release process.

  I loved getting to see this project from idea to production!
  Before my internship ended, I got to see the
  [NBCNews.com](http://www.nbcnews.com/) team transition to
  fully relying on my ReleaseBot
  for code release communication. A month after my internship ended, I received
  word that the bot is now also being used to release
  [Today.com](http://www.today.com/)!

* ["Tapesko" search engine](https://github.com/mutuarization/codeu-tapesko-new),
  with Eric Musyoka and Gargi Sharma. We
  first implemented a basic search engine through a
  [learn.co course](https://learn.co/tracks/java-cs/). Building off of Gargi's
  search engine implementation, we decided how to
  improve the search engine, and worked remotely and then at a hack day to
  implement our improvements. I created the front-end using Google App Engine
  and Java servlets. I also designed the Tapesko logo, created
  [slides](./tapesko/slides.pdf), and led our team presentation.
  Created as part of Google's CodeU mentorship program.

### Spring 2016


* [Info Vis: College Diversity in the NESCAC schools](./infovis-collegediversity/)
  done with Emily Sarich as part of our Information Visualization class. The work
  included meeting with admissions at Middlebury College, data collection from
  various NESCAC school websites, hours of data cleaning, planning what to explore
  in the data and how to present the data, and implementing our visualizations
  with D3.js in a website.

* [Info Vis: Explanation of SparkClouds](./infovis-sparkclouds/)
  done with Aayam Poudel as part of our Information Visualization class. The work
  included research, creating a website, and presenting a description and
  analysis for the class.

* [Ruby on Rails web app for Campus Events](https://peaceful-harbor-11027.herokuapp.com/)
  created with Trevor Truog, with help from Kevin Skoglund's Lynda.com
  [Ruby on Rails 4 Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/Ruby-Rails-tutorials/Ruby-Rails-4-Essential-Training/139989-2.html).
  Used Ruby on Rails, MVC framework, HTML, and CSS. Created and maintained
  an SQL database through Rails, including a rich join table and data
  validation on forms. Deployed app with Heroku.

  You can explore the app on [Heroku](https://peaceful-harbor-11027.herokuapp.com/).
  Unfortunately,
  creating and searching for events does not currently work in the deployed
  version, because the solr gem (used for searching)
  requires a paid Heroku add-on to work. However, everything works
  well if you run the app locally, which you can do based on the app's
  [README](https://github.com/truogtr/CampusEvents/blob/master/README.rdoc). ([GitHub](https://github.com/truogtr/CampusEvents))

### Fall 2015

* [Small full-stack codebase](https://github.com/jamiehand/learning-tornado)
  that helped me learn and showcase interactive information visualization. I used Python
  with Tornado to serve the site, which mostly consists of one static page. The
  static page, though, calls an ElasticSearch server to get the information to
  be visualized, using elasticsearch-py. I also made a [video demo](https://youtu.be/JJ6BN8t3a1Y)
  of the project, including a tour of the code.

* [A History of Western Music](./history-of-western-music), a
  website covering a brief overview of Western music from the Medieval Period
  to the Baroque Era.
  ([GitHub](https://github.com/jamiehand/jamiehand.github.io/tree/master/projects/history-of-western-music))

### Summer 2015

* [Python client library](https://github.com/jamiehand/osf_api_v2_client)
  for interacting with the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io) API.
  This was my main project as a Software Developer intern
  with the [Center for Open Science](http://centerforopenscience.org).
  Note that client is still a work in progress (and that progress
  passed into the hands of another developer at the end of
  August 2015).

  My work was to create the foundation of design, tests,
  implementation, and documentation for the library. The goal of the project
  is to expand the reach of the OSF API to users with basic Python knowledge,
  and to provide an example for 60+ Center for Open Science developers to build
  software using the new OSF API. I also designed thorough documentation of my
  work to onboard the next developer to the client library project.
