* Spring 2016: [Explanation of SparkClouds](http://jamiechand.com/infovis-sparkclouds/)
  done with Aayam Poudel as part of our Information Visualization class. The work
  included research, creating a website, and presenting a description and
  analysis for the class.

* Fall 2016: [Small full-stack codebase](https://github.com/jamiehand/learning-tornado)
  that helped me learn and showcase interactive information visualization. I used Python
  with Tornado to serve the site, which mostly consists of one static page. The
  static page, though, calls an ElasticSearch server to get the information to
  be visualized, using elasticsearch-py. I also made a [video demo](https://youtu.be/JJ6BN8t3a1Y)
  of the project, including a tour of the code.

* Fall 2015: [A History of Western Music](./history-of-western-music)

* Summer 2015: [Python client library](https://github.com/jamiehand/osf_api_v2_client)
  for interacting with the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io) API.
  This was my main project as a Software Developer intern
  with the [Center for Open Science](http://centerforopenscience.org).
  Note that client is still a work in progress (and that progress
  passed into the hands of another developer at the end of
  August 2015).

  My work was to create the foundation of design, tests,
  implementation, and documentation for the library. The goal of the project
  is to expand the reach of the OSF API to users with basic Python knowledge,
  and to provide an example for 60+ Center for Open Science developers to build
  software using the new OSF API. I also designed thorough documentation of my
  work to onboard the next developer to the client library project.
