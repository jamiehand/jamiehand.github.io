title: A History of Black Women's Agency in Romantic Relationships with Men
---

<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

This project provides a look at Black women's individual autonomy in
their romantic relationships with men in four eras from the
late 19th century to the present, through the analysis of one pop culture
artifact from each era, along with scholarly texts. It was created
in December 2016, as a
culminating project for my Black Womanhood in Popular Culture class
with Professor J Finley of Middlebury College.

Thank you for everything, Professor Finley!

      The artifact is an HBO documentary that includes readings of interviews
      with the final generation of African Americans born into slavery in
      the US. During the period of slavery in the US, Black women had little
      to no agency in their romantic lives; even if a woman was allowed to
      choose a partner, she (or her partner) could be sold at any time.
      Furthermore, white male masters often committed sexual violence and
      non-consensual sexual acts against enslaved Black women.

      The artifact is Bessie Smith's blues song "Thinking Blues." Scholars
      have mixed opinions on the utility of blues as a form for Black women
      to express themselves and their sexuality. In some ways, blues music
      provides a platform to express themselves, but to the extent that men
      are the ones writing lyrics for these women, sometimes blues has
      caused women to be complicit in perpetuating images of themselves as
      hyper-sexualized.

      The artifact is Nikki Giovanni reading an excerpt from her book
      <i>Gemini</i> (1976). Giovanni is part of the Black Arts Movement, an arm of
      the Black Arts Movement. This excerpt demonstrates/reveals a nuanced
      understanding of Black women's relationship to Black men in the US.
      On the one hand, Giovanni sees Black men as being controlled by the
      Black women in their lives; on the other, Giovanni herself resists
      being held back, controlled, or defined by a romantic partner.

      The artifact is "The Stop Sign": Season 1, Episode 1 of <i>The Mis-Adventures
      of Awkward Black Girl</i> (2011). This show is created by Issa Rae, who
      also is the star and protagonist of the show. Issa Rae plays J, who
      is not opposed to being in relationships, but she is not defined by
      her relationships, and she unapologetically
      makes her own decisions about her body and her identity.
