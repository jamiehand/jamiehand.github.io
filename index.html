<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hello world, I am Jamie Hand!</h1>
	<p>I'm a senior <a href="/about#feb">feb</a> Computer 
	Science major at <a href=
	"http://www.middlebury.edu"> Middlebury College</a>. 
	I am a software engineer interested in learning all that
	I can about software, computers, and the systems that make 
	our daily lives work. </p>
	<p>I recently interned with the
	<a href="http://centerforopenscience.org">
	Center for Open Science</a> doing software development,
	working mostly with creating a Python client library
	for interacting with the API for their main service, 
	the <a href="https://osf.io">Open Science Framework</a>. 
	The client is still a work in progress (and that progress
	passed into the hands of another developer at the end of
	August 2015), but it can be found <a href=
	"https://github.com/jamiehand/osf_api_v2_client">here</a>.
	<p>This site is also a work in progress, but please
	look around and learn more about me, my interests,
	and my work. I'm glad you're here -- enjoy, and have
	a great day!</p>
